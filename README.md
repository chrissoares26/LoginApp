# Overview

This is a continuation of a previous iOS app. I built an registration and login screen using firebase authentication. Once registered, the user is able to see what is inside the app.

# Cloud Database

I used Firebase authentication services. It is a free service and it is easy to use.
The structure of my database is simple. It requires the first name, last name, email, password and in the future will also require a profile picture.

# Development Environment

The language used is Swift.
I used Xcode to build the app.
You need to either have a Macbook or a virtual machine running macOS in order to use Xcode
